        All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out
        Here you go, trippin'
        Everything is cool between us Bey
        I told you that
        We out on the road with my people
        Just doin' what I gotta do
        There's nothing goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on
        You gotta trust me, Ma
        I can't believe I believed
        Everything we had would last
        So young and naive for me to think
        She was from your past
        Silly of me to dream of
        One day having your kids
        Love is so blind
        It feels right when it's wrong
        I can't believe I fell for your schemes
        I'm smarter than that
        So dumb and naive to believe that with me
        You're a changed man
        Foolish of me to compete
        When you cheat with loose women
        It took me some time but now I moved on
        Because I realized I got
        Me, myself and I
        That's all I got in the end
        That's what I found out
        And it ain't no need to cry
        I took a vow that from now on
        I'm gon' be my own best friend
        Me, myself and I
        That's all I got in the end
        That's what I found out
        And it ain't no need to cry
        I took a vow that from now on
        I'm gon' be my own best friend
        So controlling, you say that you love me
        But you don't
        Your family told me one day
        I would see it on my own
        Next thing I know I'm dealing
        With your three kids in my home
        Love is so blind
        It feels right when it's wrong
        Now that it's over
        Stop calling me
        Come pick up your clothes
        Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
        All your homies know
        Even your very best friend
        Tried to warn me on the low
        It took me some time
        But now I am strong
        Because I realized I got
        Me, myself and I
        That's all I got in the end
        That's what I found out
        And it ain't no need to cry
        I took a vow that from now on
        I'm gonna be my own best friend
        Me, myself and I
        That's all I got in the end
        That's what I found out
        And it ain't no need to cry
        I took a vow that from now on
        I'm gon' be my own best friend
        I know that I will never disappoint myself
        (I must have cried a thousand times)
        All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
        (I can't regret all the time spent with you)
        Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
        (It's how I learned how to make it through)
        After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
        I know that I will never disappoint myself
        (I must have cried a thousand times)
        All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
        (I can't regret all the time spent with you)
        Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
        (It's how I learned how to make it through)
        After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
        Yeah, -eah
        Oh-oh, oh-oh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh
        Oh-oh, oh-oh
        Whoo-ooh
        Whoo-ooh-ooh
        Now I've got me, myself and I
        (Me, myself and I)
        I must have cried a thousand times
        (I have cried so many times)
        I can't regret time spent with you
        (I can't regret time spent with you)
        It's how I learned how to make it through
        (After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again)
        Now I've got me, myself and I
        (I know that I will never disappoint myself)
        I must have cried a thousand times
        (If you've cried a thousand times, ladies you will survive)
        I can't regret time spent with you
        (Yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
        It's how I learned how to make it through
        (I can see the sun shine, I've got me, myself and I)
